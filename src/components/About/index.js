            <h3 className='about'>About the developer:</h3>
                <p className='about-pg'>Megan is originally from Durham, North Carolina, and graduated from Davidson College in 2019 with a degree in Art History. After making her way back to Durham by way of Boston, MA, she enrolled at UNC Charlotte's full stack development bootcamp. She has previously worked as a barista at a local coffeeshop, and enjoyed the bustle of a busy day, as there was always something to occupy the mind. Before working as a barista, she served as an intern in the Development department at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA, and was sad to see the internship cut short due to COVID-19. In her free time, she enjoys yoga, reading, and playing The Legend of Zelda (she has already completed Breath of the Wild twice, and is anxiously awaiting part two).</p>
